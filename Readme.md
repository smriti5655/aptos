The Decentralized Music Streaming Platform allows artists to upload their music directly onto the blockchain, enabling listeners to stream songs while paying royalties instantly through smart contracts. The platform eliminates intermediaries, ensuring that artists receive their earnings fairly and immediately.

- **Artist Profiles**: Provide artists with customizable profiles to showcase their work and interact with their audience.
- **Analytics and Insights**: Build analytics features to provide artists with insights on listener engagement and revenue.
- **Collaborative Playlists**: Create collaborative playlist features where listeners can create and share playlists while compensating artists for each stream.
